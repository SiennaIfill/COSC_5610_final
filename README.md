# Marquette Basketball  Predictor and Analytics

This repository addresses the challenge of optimizing basketball team performance through data analysis. By examining Marquette University's men's basketball team data, this project identifies critical performance indicators and comparative strengths/weaknesses. The resulting insights provide a foundation for developing effective game strategies and team-building approaches, with the objective of maximizing winning outcomes.

This repo contains the ipynb files and Marquette dataset we used to figure out key statistics on MU basketball games, team, and built a game predictor using logistic regression
